## Overview

*Terminal-Icons* is a PowerShell module that adds file and folder icons when displaying items in the terminal.
This relies on the custom fonts provided by [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

> You must be using one of the fonts provided by Nerd Fonts for this module to work as these fonts include tons of custom glyphs/icons that are referenced by their unicode number.

## How Does this Work?

It uses a custom [format.ps1xml](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_format.ps1xml?view=powershell-6) file that inspects the items being displayed and looks up their appropriate icon based on name or extension.
Icons for well-known files/folders are attempted to be used first before displaying an icon based on the file extension.
Any files/folders that are not matched are shown using a generic file or folder icon.

## Installation

## Tips

If using the default console in Windows and not something like VSCode, ConEmu, Terminus, etc., you may have issues getting a nerd font to be recognized correctly.
